a) In a non-Agile project, there is not guanenteed to be an equivalent
to the Product Owner because many non-Agile methods are not iterative.
Many of the roles of the Product Owner rely on consistent testing and
customer feedback, something that is much more diffcult to achieve in a
non-Agile setting. However, a Product Owner is crucial for Agile projects.
The Product Owner is responsible for budgeting, timeline, maintenance,
testing, and planning of the project, which is crucial for a long-term
project, especially one that operates in many short-term sprints.

b) The Scrum Master is responsible for leading the development team, which
involves delegating tasks and tracking project progress. The Product Owner,
on the other hand, is responsible for making sure that the direction the
project is headed is benefitting the company and client, and that major
milestones and customer expectations are being fulfilled.

c) The first meeting type is the spring planning meeting, where agile team
members 1) plan tasks for the sprint, and 2) perform task effort estimation
and task allocation

The second meeting type is the sprint retrospective meeting, where team
members 1) look back on the completed sprint, and 2) assess weak points and
move unfinished tasks to the backlog

The final type of meeting is a scrum meeting, which happens daily, to
1) discuss what was completed during the previous day, and 2) discuss what
will be completed on the current day, as well as any roadblocks to completing
those tasks.
